# CPP_CalcBit
This is a simply bitwise calculator.

==========================================
Descriptions of using and installation:  +
==========================================
1. Run make utility. You'll get binary-file;
2. Run binary-file such as CalcBitwise;
3. If you need to install this calculator then;
you need to run this command such as "make install" after item one;
4. If you need to uninstall it then yoy need
you need to run the command such as "make uninstall" after item three;
5. At the end you can delete all the resulting files after item one.

=========================================
Description of the programm		+
=========================================
1. We get token from the input-stream
The type Token declare in the Token.cpp and
define in the Token.hpp;

2. We put this token in the token-stream.
The algorithm works with it.
The type TokenStream declare in the TokenStream.cpp and
define in the Token.hpp;

3. Each token is parsed accordint to the rules.
These rulse is descripted in Parser. You can look at bellow.
The parser declare in the Parser.cpp and
define in the Parser.hpp.

The rules:
1) Priority 5. Handle binary bitwise operator OR;
-Expression:
secondTerm
Expression OR secondTerm

2) Priority 4. Handle binary bitwise operator XOR;
-secondTerm:
firstTerm
secondTerm XOR firstTerm

3) Priority 3. Handle binary bitwise operator AND;
-firstTerm:
Primary
firstTerm AND Primary

4) Prioriry 2. Handle unary bitwise complement operator ~;
Priority 1. Handle unary logical operator NOT;
Priority 0. Handle '(' Expression ')'
-Primary:
'(' Expression ')'
! Expression
~ Expression

5) Return value as an integer;
-Number:
integer
